# codewars
I'm committed to doing a codewars every single day to constantly improve. I use the PREP method of approaching these problems. Think through what parameters will be passed in, what the function will be return, examples, and then writing out pseudo code. 

In addition to the PREP method, think through alternative approaches and solutions.

## optimizations

Go through the code to refactor the original implementation.
